## Exploratory Data Analysis

An initial analysis was conducted to understand the dataset's structure and identify key variables:
- Basic statistics and distributions of player features.
- Correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- Visualizations to highlight trends and anomalies.

---

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Key steps included:
- Handling missing values using imputation strategies.
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features for consistency.
- Creating dummy variables for categorical data.
- Engineering new features such as `years_remaining` and player `categories`.

---

## Feature Selection

Various methods were explored to select the most relevant features for modeling, including:
1. **Stepwise Selection (AIC and BIC)**
2. **Boruta Algorithm**
3. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**
4. **Random Forest Feature Importance**

The final selected features differ based on the modeling technique used, ensuring the best predictive performance.

---

## Modeling and Evaluation

Multiple machine learning models were applied and tuned, such as:
- **Linear Regression**: For baseline performance.
- **Random Forest**: To capture non-linear relationships.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: To model complex interactions.

Evaluation metrics:
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
- **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.

---

## Results and Conclusions

Key findings:
- Models using features like `release_clause_eur_m`, `potential`, and `overall` performed exceptionally well.
- Neural networks provided the best results with optimized parameters, achieving RMSE as low as **0.5115** in cross-validation.


---

## Future Work

Potential improvements include:
- Incorporating additional datasets, such as player injuries or transfer market trends.
- Experimenting with ensemble methods.
- Deploying the model as an API for real-time market value predictions.
